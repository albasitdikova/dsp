[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)


This functon computes the Cohen effect size (was given in the book):


```python
def CohenEffectSize(group1, group2):
    """Computes Cohen's effect size for two groups.
    
    group1: Series or DataFrame
    group2: Series or DataFrame
    
    returns: float if the arguments are Series;
             Series if the arguments are DataFrames
    """
    diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()

    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    n1, n2 = len(group1), len(group2)

    pooled_var = (n1 * var1 + n2 * var2) / (n1 + n2)
    d = diff / np.sqrt(pooled_var)
    return d
```

Compute the Cohen effect size for the difference in pregnancy length for first babies and others.


```python
CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngth)
```




    0.028879044654449883



d = 0.029

Difference in pregnancy lenght for first babies and others are trivial because d(Cohen Effect Size) < 0.2

## Exercises

Using the variable `totalwgt_lb`, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. 

Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups.  How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?


```python
CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
```




    -0.088672927072602



## Solution

d = -0.089


Cohen Effect is negative what means first babies are usually lighter than other. But because absolute value of d < 0.2, effect size is small.

Difference in weight between first and other babies is trivial
